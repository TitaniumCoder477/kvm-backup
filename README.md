> A simple backup tool for KVM virtual machines that leverages GPG for encryption and compression

## What is the project?

kvm-backup is a simple, decoupled, modularized backup utility that employes GPG for encryption and compression. At present, there is some legacy code that reference Restic as that program was used prior to GPG.

## What is the MVP?

The minimal valuable product is software that successfully and automatically backs up VMs that can be manually restored successfully.

## What are the nice to haves?

The nice to haves for this project would be retention, multiple destinations, restore functions, etc.

## When will the project be complete?

The project will be complete once the software is usable to protect the virtual machines.
